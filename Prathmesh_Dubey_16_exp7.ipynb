It involves \"the discovery by computer of new, previously unknown information, by automatically extracting information from different written resources.\"[1] Written resources may include websites, books, emails, reviews, and articles. High-quality information is typically obtained by devising patterns and trends by means such as statistical pattern learning. According to Hotho et al. (2005) we can distinguish between three different perspectives of text mining: information extraction, data mining, and a knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) process.[2] Text mining usually involves the process of structuring the input text (usually parsing, along with the addition of some derived linguistic features and the removal of others, and subsequent insertion into a database), deriving patterns within the structured data, and finally evaluation and interpretation of the output. 'High quality' in text mining usually refers to some combination of relevance, novelty, and interest. Typical text mining tasks include text categorization, text clustering, concept/entity extraction, production of granular taxonomies, sentiment analysis, document summarization, and entity relation modeling (i.e., learning relations between named entities).\n",

( 2005 ) we can distinguish between three different perspective of text mining : information extraction , data mining , and a knowledge discovery in database ( KDD ) process.[2 ] text mining usually involve the process of structure the input text ( usually parse , along with the addition of some derive linguistic feature and the removal of other , and subsequent insertion into a database ) , derive pattern within the structured datum , and finally evaluation and interpretation of the output . ' high quality ' in text mining usually refer to some combination of relevance , novelty , and interest . typical text mining task include text categorization , text clustering , concept / entity extraction , production of granular taxonomy , sentiment analysis , document summarization , and entity relation modeling ( i.e. , learn relation between name entity ) . \n",

High-quality information is typically obtained by devising patterns and trends by means such as statistical pattern learning. According to Hotho et al. (2005) we can distinguish between three different perspectives of text mining: information extraction, data mining, and a knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) process.[2] Text mining usually involves the process of structuring the input text (usually parsing, along with the addition of some derived linguistic features and the removal of others, and subsequent insertion into a database), deriving patterns within the structured data, and finally evaluation and interpretation of the output. 'High quality' in text mining usually refers to some combination of relevance, novelty, and interest. Typical text mining tasks include text categorization, text clustering, concept/entity extraction, production of granular taxonomies, sentiment analysis, document summarization, and entity relation modeling (i.e., learning relations between named entities).\\n\"\n"

        "\n",
        "1. **Data gathering:**\n",
        "In this stage, you gather text data from internal or external sources.\n",
        "> Internal data: Internal data is text content that is internal to your business and is readily available—for example, emails, chats, invoices, and employee surveys.\n",
        "\n",
        " > External data:  You can find external data in sources such as social media posts, online reviews, news articles, and online forums. It is harder to acquire external data because it is beyond your control. You might need to use web scraping tools or integrate with third-party solutions to extract external data.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Data preparation:**\n",
        "Data preparation is an essential part of text analysis. It involves structuring raw text data in an acceptable format for analysis. The text analysis software automates the process and involves the following common natural language processing (NLP) methods.\n",
        "> Tokenization: Tokenization is segregating the raw text into multiple parts that make semantic sense. For example, the phrase text analytics benefits businesses tokenizes to the words text, analytics, benefits, and businesses.\n",
        "\n",
        " > Part-of-speech tagging: Part-of-speech tagging assigns grammatical tags to the tokenized text. For example, applying this step to the previously mentioned tokens results in text: Noun; analytics: Noun; benefits: Verb; businesses: Noun.\n",
        "\n",
        " >Parsing : Parsing establishes meaningful connections between the tokenized words with English grammar. It helps the text analysis software visualize the relationship between words.\n",
        "\n",
        " >Lemmatization: Lemmatization is a linguistic process that simplifies words into their dictionary form, or lemma. For example, the dictionary form of visualizing is visualize.\n",
        "\n",
        " >Stop words removal: Stop words are words that offer little or no semantic context to a sentence, such as and, or, and for. Depending on the use case, the software might remove them from the structured text.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Text analysis:**\n",
        "Text analysis is the core part of the process, in which text analysis software processes the text by using different methods.\n",
        "> Text classification: Classification is the process of assigning tags to the text data that are based on rules or machine learning-based systems.\n",
        "\n",
        " >Text extraction: Extraction involves identifying the presence of specific keywords in the text and associating them with tags. The software uses methods such as regular expressions and conditional random fields (CRFs) to do this.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Visualization:**\n",
        "Visualization is about turning the text analysis results into an easily understandable format. You will find text analytics results in graphs, charts, and tables. The visualized results help you identify patterns and trends and build action plans. For example, suppose you’re getting a spike in product returns, but you have trouble finding the causes. With visualization, you look for words such as defects, wrong size, or not a good fit in the feedback and tabulate them into a chart. Then you’ll know which is the major issue that takes top priority."
